# hello-world

Hi everyone!

# I'm hoping to get started with contributing to open source projects.  This is the first repository that I have ever created.  Looks like this is the kind of file # that someone could put their code into.  I will go ahead, and add in some code that I used to create my first C program, ever.  

# This is how to write the program "hello.c" in the C language.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return (0);
}

#  If you are using Ubuntu Linux, just follow these steps to create, and compile this program.
#  Step 1:  Open up a terminal from the Ubuntu Desktop by pressing "Ctrl + Alt + T."  
#  Step 2:  Make sure that you have the nano editor installed on your machine using "sudo apt-get install nano".
#  Step 3:  After you have installed nano type "sudo nano hello.c" to create the file that you will put the C code in.
#  Step 4:  Type the code that you see above these steps into your file.  Type in the program exactly as it appears above these steps.
#  Step 5:  Save your file by pressing "Ctrl + X", and then press y to answer the question "Save modified buffer?", then press "Enter" to save.
#  Step 6:  At the prompt, type "sudo gcc hello.c -o hello", and press enter.  This will compile your code, and make it into an executable binary file.
#  Step 7:  To run your program type "./hello", and press "Enter".  If everything worked right, you should see the phrase "Hello, World!" print in the terminal.
#  Congratulate yourself on creating your first ever computer program in the C language.  Maybe even enjoy a snack!

#  This is how to write the program "hello.py" in the Python language.

print("Hello, World!")

#  Step 2:  Make sure that you have the nano editor installed on your machine using "sudo apt-get install nano".
#  Step 3:  After you have installed nano type "sudo nano hello.py" to create the file that you will put the Python code in.

#  Step 5:  Save your file by pressing "Ctrl + X", and then press y to answer the question "Save modified buffer?", then press "Enter" to save.
#  Step 6:  At the prompt, type "python hello.py", and press enter.  This will tell the python interpreter to run your program.
#  Step 7:  If everything worked right, you should see the phrase "Hello, World!" print in the terminal.
